### DnDYourself 
This is an application that is designed through the use of a simple form to create a Dungeons and Dragons (5th Edition) character at 1st level that represents the user. How would you fair within the DnD ruleset and worlds?

## Form
The form will ask specific questions that relate to the various mechanics represented within the DnD ruleset, often deliberately hidden to avoid the temptation of abuse. The more honest and accurate the user input the more likeness that they will feel with the end product. Are you a performing artist? Have you trained in unarmed combat? What is your profession? How fit are you? Strong? Healthy? What about your personality?

## Character
An incomplete character sheet will be the end-goal of this project. A blank canvas that the player could choose to then put a dnd class on top of before joining a game.
